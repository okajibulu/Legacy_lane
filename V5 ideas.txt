Some More Master Admin Roles to consider and use to update what we have alredy. These are some of the ideas I had worked on with previous AI. We also use the details to add to knowledgebase info

📊 1. Real-time Metrics & Analytics
Member growth charts and statistics

Activity monitoring (logins, engagement)

Subscription status and payment tracking

Demographic insights (age, location, etc.)

👥 2. Advanced Member Management
Complete member database with search/filter

Role management (Member → Admin promotion)

Member relocation between groups/cohorts

Account (and Member) suspension/deletion capabilities

Bulk operations and CSV export

🏷️ 3. Terminology Customization
Dynamic naming system for groups ("Class of", "Set of", "Batch of", etc)

Custom terminology for all community elements

Multi-language support foundation

🎯 4. Group & Subgroup Management
Create/maintain groups and subgroups

Executive committees management

Special interest groups

Hierarchy and organizational structure

⚙️ 5. Community Configuration
Branding customization (colors, logos)

Feature toggles (blog, events, marketplace)

Privacy and visibility settings

Automated message customization

For our gamification, I prefer a points based system and it would be the system that will be capturing all the data so it is essential we use measurable indices that removes vagueness in the determination of the winners. We still need to gather lots of ideas and then be able to come up with a system that will work best for us. So i will add more ideas and then we compare, extract as needed and form our path.
